# PS5 FTP Payload
ps5-payload-ftpsrv is a simple FTP server that can be executed on a Playstation 5
that has been jailbroken via the [BD-J][bdj] or the [webkit][webkit] entry points.

## Building
Assuming you have the [ps5-payload-sdk][sdk] installed on a POSIX machine,
the FTP server can be compiled using the following two commands:
```console
john@localhost:ps5-payload-ftpsrv$ export PS5_PAYLOAD_SDK=/opt/ps5-payload-sdk
john@localhost:ps5-payload-ftpsrv$ make
```

To deploy the payload, first launch the [ps5-payload-elfldr][elfldr], then
load ftpsrv.elf by issuing the following command:
```console
john@localhost:ps5-payload-ftpsrv$ nc -q0 PS5_HOST 9021 < ftpsrv.elf
```

You can also compile the FTP server for POSIX-like systems (tested with Ubuntu
and FreeBSD):
```console
john@localhost:ps5-payload-ftpsrv$ make -f Makefile.posix
john@localhost:ps5-payload-ftpsrv$ ./ftpsrv.posix.elf
```

## Features
Client software that has been testing include gFTP, Filezilla, curl, and Thunar.
Furthermore, the payload supports a couple of custom SITE commands specifically
for the PS5 (executed without prepending SITE). In particular:
 - KILL - kill the FTP server.
 - MTRW - remount /system and /system_ex with write permissions.
