# PS5 FTP Payload
ftps5-payload is a simple FTP server that can be executed on a Playstation 5
that has been jailbroken via the [BD-J][bdj] or [webkit][webkit] entry points.

## Building
Assuming you have the [ps5-payload-sdk][sdk] installed on a POSIX machine,
the FTP server can be compiled using the following two commands:
```console
john@localhost:ftps5-payload$ export PS5_PAYLOAD_SDK=/opt/ps5-payload-sdk
john@localhost:ftps5-payload$ make
```

You can also compile the FTP server for POSIX-like systems (tested with Ubuntu
and FreeBSD):
```console
john@localhost:ftps5-payload$ make -f Makefile.posix
john@localhost:ftps5-payload$ ./ftp-server.elf
```

## Features
Client software that has been testing include gFTP, Filezilla, and Thunar.
Furthermore, the payload supports a couple of custom SITE commands specifically
for the PS5 (executed without prepending SITE). In particular:
 - KILL - kill the FTP server. This allows you to launch other payloads.
 - MTRW - remount /system and /system_ex with write permissions.
